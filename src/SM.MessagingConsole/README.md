# SM.MessagingConsole :computer:

*(This was renamed from SM.Messaging.Console, because the compiler would need explicit naming of System.Console in order to resolve that class.)*

* `dotnet new console` generates the console template which includes `Program.cs` and the `.csproj` file.

* `dotnet add reference ..\SM.Messaging.Interfaces\SM.Messaging.Interfaces.csproj` includes the class library into this console project.
