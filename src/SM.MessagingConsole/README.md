# SM.MessagingConsole

*(This was renamed from SM.Messaging.Console, because the compiler would need explicit naming of System.Console in order to resolve that class.)*

* The console template which includes `Program.cs` and the `.csproj` file was initialized by using the following command: `dotnet new console`

* `dotnet add reference ..\SM.Messaging.Interfaces\SM.Messaging.Interfaces.csproj`
